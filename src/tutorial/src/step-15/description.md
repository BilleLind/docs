# You Did It!

You have finished the tutorial!

At this point, you should have a good idea of what it's like to work with Vue. However, we covered a lot of things really fast and glossed over the details, so definitely keep learning! As a next step, you can:

- Set up a real Vue project on your machine by following the <a target="_blank" href="/guide/quick-start.html"> Quick Start </a>.

- Go through the <a target="_blank" href="/guide/essentials/application.html"> Main Guide </a>, which covers all the topics we learned so far in greater details, and much more.

- Check out some more practical <a target="_blank" href="/examples"> Examples </a>.

We can't wait to see what you build next!
